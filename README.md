ü´Å About Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer worldwide. It begins in the lungs, where abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and form tumors that interfere with normal respiratory functions. If not detected early, these cancerous cells can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, making treatment more difficult.

üîë Key Points:

Causes: Majorly linked to smoking, second-hand smoke, exposure to toxic substances (asbestos, radon), air pollution, and genetic factors.

Types of Lung Cancer:

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): The most common type (about 85% of cases).

Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC): A more aggressive and rapidly spreading type.

Symptoms: Persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and coughing up blood.

Prevention & Detection: Avoiding tobacco, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, early screening (such as low-dose CT scans), and awareness of risk factors are crucial.

Treatment: Depends on the stage and type of cancer‚Äîoptions include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

üåç Why It Matters:

Early detection of lung cancer can significantly improve survival rates. With advancements in machine learning and AI-based prediction models, it is now possible to analyze patient data and predict risks, aiding in timely diagnosis and treatment.

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to predict lung cancer risk using clinical and lifestyle data. The goal is to assist in early detection and support healthcare professionals in decision-making.

üîß Key Features:

Applied hybrid feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant attributes for accurate prediction.

Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) and compared their performance.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for balanced performance analysis.

Designed the system to help reduce false negatives, ensuring high sensitivity in detecting high-risk patients.

üéØ Impact:

By leveraging machine learning, this project aims to:

Improve early detection of lung cancer.

Reduce diagnostic delays by analyzing patient data effectively.

Provide a decision support tool for doctors and researchers.
